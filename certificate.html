    <h2>1.  Mobile Application Development</h2>
    <p>
      I attended a Workshop on Mobile Application Development organized by IGDTUW, 
      where I learned the fundamentals of designing and building mobile-first solutions. 
      The workshop covered the mobile app development lifecycle, from planning and design to testing and deployment, 
      giving me a clear picture of how applications are created.
      I was introduced to UI/UX design principles, app architecture, client-server communication, 
      and the basics of APIs and databases. The sessions also provided insights into emerging technologies 
      like AI, IoT, and cloud integration in mobile platforms.
      Apart from technical knowledge, the workshop helped me improve my communication and collaboration skills 
      through interaction with faculty and peers. While I have not yet built a complete app, 
      this experience motivated me to apply my learning in future academic projects and hackathons.

    <h2>2.AI-Powered Full-stack Development</h2>
    <p>
      I completed a eight-week Summer Internship on AI-Powered Web Application Development 
      at IGDTUW, where I developed a strong foundation in full-stack development 
      and gained exposure to integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into real-world applications.
      The internship began with strengthening my skills in frontend technologies 
      like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which helped me understand how to design responsive and user-friendly interfaces. 
      Alongside this, I explored backend development and database management, learning 
      how data flows through applications and how logic and databases ensure smooth functionality.
      A key highlight was learning the fundamentals of AI/ML, including supervised and unsupervised learning 
      and their applications in modern software systems. I gained insights into how intelligent models 
      can analyze data, recognize patterns, and be embedded into full-stack projects to enhance user experience.
      Working under the guidance of mentors and collaborating with peers, I improved my problem-solving, research, and teamwork skills. 
      I also learned how to approach development from an end-to-end perspective, including requirement gathering, planning, coding, and testing.
      Although I have not yet built a project based on this internship, I now have the confidence and technical knowledge to create applications 
      like AI-based recommendation systems or intelligent chatbots. This internship was a transformative step in 
      my journey as a Computer Science Engineering student, preparing me for future projects, hackathons, and career opportunities.
