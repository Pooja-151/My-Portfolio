    <h2>1. Virus Survival Game</h2>
    <p>
      Virus Survival is a browser-based interactive game designed to test 
      players’ reflexes, strategy, and decision-making skills. 
      In the game, players must carefully navigate through a field filled with 
      bombs, viruses, and walls while avoiding traps that can send them back to the starting point. 
      Along the way, players can collect shields for protection and use AI-powered hints to plan their moves 
      and survive longer. The game also tracks important metrics such as points, time survived, and progress, 
      offering a competitive and engaging experience.This project allowed me to enhance 
      my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, especially in areas like DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic implementation, 
      and AI integration. It demonstrates my ability to combine creativity, problem-solving, 
      and technical knowledge to build interactive and user-friendly applications.

    <h2>2.AI-Powered Marketplace Assistant for Local Artisans</h2>
    <p>
      The AI-Powered Marketplace Assistant for Local Artisans is a hackathon prototype 
      developed by a collaborative team of five members. 
      The idea behind this project is to bridge the gap between traditional artistry 
      and modern digital platforms by equipping local artisans with AI-driven tools. 
      Many artists struggle with creating promotional materials or managing 
      the digital marketing side of their work, which often limits their reach and potential income. 
      To address this, our platform offers multiple AI-powered features such as 
      generating professional-quality posters, creating short promotional videos, 
      and assisting with social media content including captions, bios, and relevant hashtags.
      Additionally, the system provides intelligent price suggestions to help artisans evaluate 
      the fair and competitive value of their products in the market. 
      By combining these tools into a single accessible web application, the project aims to reduce 
      the marketing and branding challenges faced by artisans, giving them more time to focus on their creative work 
      while still reaching a wider and more relevant audience.
